Rust implementation of [browscap](https://browscap.org/) user agent parser, ported from browscap-java.

## Note
This is an early port with different performance characteristics than the Java version. Some operations are faster, others are slower. Use with appropriate expectations.
It will first be used in my [free url shortener](https://www.nav2.me) service.
